The change of nature does not cause the change of court nor does the
change of court cause the change in nature.  With the fae such things as
cause are irrelevent, they simply are.  It is one of the things that make
the fae so able to facinate mortals.
~
E
page1~
The Seelie and Unseelie houses are the cornerstone of the fae nature.
The Seelie is all that is chivalrous, good, fair, beautiful, light and
graceful while the Unseelie is the counterpart of each of these
qualities.  Just as the fae court switches alliances with each season so
do individual fae.  While being immortal in nature, the fae are not
unchanging.  The fae switch from one court to another at times within
their existence.  The change is one of internal alliance and a once
honest and loving Seelie fae can become a dishonest and distrusting one
by changing courts.

The Fool seems to also ignore the house differences.  He seems to owe no
particular alliegence to either court and seems to retain full use of his
seemingly addled faculties throughout the year despite the seasonal
variences that so affect his kind.
~
E
page1~
Puck is perhaps the single most powerful of all the fae.  Even Gwyn ap
Nudd and Oberon pay this wanderer heed.  While usually he is nothing more
than a trickster it seems that he is the only fae that has not gone a
change of roles since the last cycle of fae existence. Why the Fool is
exempt from these yearly changes is a mystery that only he may know and
as is his nature he isn't telling.

not castle here.  There is however a small standing stone with some worn

The Forest Edge~
You stand on the edge of a great forest.  Ancient trunks extend form
the earth up into the heavens seemingly holding up the sky itself.
Further into the forest it seems as if the sky is the trees as the canopy
above obscures all but fleeting glimpses of blue skies. The forest extends in
all  directions.

All around you are massive trees with emerald leaves and silver
bark.  The forest floor is covered in flowers and soft mosses.  Sunlight
filters softly through the canopy above lighting the world with a soft
difused glow.

toward what looks to be an inn.

This large cavern looks like it gets very little use and a lot less
cleaning.  A few pots lie in a sink and several dirty plates lie in piles
on the large stone table in the centre of the room.  The room is well lit
and warm and you get the feeling that if it weren't so dirty this
cavern might actually be a nice place to live.  There is what looks to be
a bedroom to the north and some kind of hall to the east.

the path to the meadow, the east the kitchen and the trophy room is to

Woven tapestries of immortal battles lie rotting in the cases beside
still gleaming swords in scabards covered in myriad patters of
interlocking spiral beadwork.  The treasured creations of some of the
realm's finest craftsmen lay in these cases just beyond your grasp.  To
the north is a bedroom and to the south you hear sounds of metalworking.

inhabits every item in this hall, but one item especially calls to you.
A tapestry on the east wall depicts two young figures, one boy and one
girl.  For a moment you long for the lost innocence of that youth and you
yearn to enter the tapestry, but then you pull yourself away from it's
strange lure.  The hall continues north and south.

This hall is all green leaves and grass of a summer day.  Golden
raidience shines down from the open roof above and birds chirp.  From
somewhere you hear a brook babbling.  The eastern wall is dominated by a
tapestry that shows two lovers in the prime of their life, and passions,
in a summer field.  You sense that if you entered the now shimmering
tapestry you too would be forever young and beautiful, unchanging and
untouchable.  The tapestry dims and you hear laughter in the distance.
The hall continues to the north and south.

The smell of fallen leaves and aproaching rain drifts sweetly through

orange, yellows, browns and pale green.  Soft rain drizzles in from the
clouded grey sky above this chamber. There is a soft quiet sense to this room,
and when you look at the tapestry on the west wall depicting a middle
aged couple resting quietly in each others arms you long for quiet
companionship and find yourself reaching toward the tapestry.  You are
shaken out of the trance by a raven's croak and you stand for a moment
confused.  The hall continues to the north and south.

This hall is carpeted in deep, light snow that seems to be falling
in from the ceiling.  Small ice statues can be seen in the distance and
the treelike branches above are covered to near breaking with ice.  A cold
wind blows with a shrill sound through the hall.  Totaly unmoved by the
wind is a bright white tapestry on the west wall that shows an old couple
whose faces show infinite wisdom and complacency.  You are entranced by
the wisdom that the old couple wears like a mantle and you suddenly
desire to seek it out by joining them in the tapestry. Then you hear a
high pitched cackling and you shiver with the cold.  The Hall continues
to the north and south.

The Watcher's Home~
This small bare room is home to one of the Fae who watches from
behind the throne of the Seelie.  Nothing of interest is in this room
other than the rag bed and the small pool of slime in the corner.

The Hidden Court~
This is the hidden court of the Unseelie Fae during the seasonal
reign of the Seelie. The room is dark and cold, totaly unlike the rest of
the currently Seelie castle. There is a large dark throne cloaked in darkness
here. You can't quite make out if it is occupied.  To the south is more
of the Dark court.

Your body is gripped by the freezing chill of ice and your mind is

Eternal Spring~
The power of eternal spring grips you and you find yourself overcome
with youth and clildish pleasure.  Your limbs have shortened and you are
no longer as tall as you once were.  It doesn't matter though because you
are young and you don't ever want to grow old.  You can stay here and be
young forever.

Behind the Hill~
In the shadow of the hill where the castle lies is a small glade.
Many woodland creatures, small and large are gathered around a little boy
playing a pipe.  The music captures you for a moment and then the boy
stops playing.
The boy says 'I will play a tune for you for the right price. What would
you hear?'
