To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.

&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.

In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.

In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.

This is a really useful little utility for builders and other imms to check
areas for all the standard entry and exit points it has, including teleport
rooms. It will not count up exits by mudprograms though.

Here's an example of its output:

To: Overland  237X  161Y From:             deme.are Room  3700 (north)

From: hdcaverns.are        Room: 29241 To: deme.are             Room  3703 (up)
From: Overland  237X  162Y To: Room  3700
From: Overland  237X  168Y To: Room  3701

The program will default to the area you are standing in if you fail to
specify an argument to it. Otherwise it accepts the filename for any

SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001

To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")

For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.

The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

Your alignment can range from +1000 to -1000. When you are +1000 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -1000 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.

Seeking to ban a site above level 1 should be an extremely rare situation. One
in which the actions of one or more key persons from a site are deemed to be
a detriment to the enjoyment of a large portion of the players in the game.
Such person(s) are generally deemed to be beyond rehabilitation at this time.

All site bans above level one should be set at level 50 or higher. It should be
a rare instance in which a site is banned at some in between level. Only in the
direst of instances would a site be banned above level 50, as this will affect
immortal level players as well.

°Fban site will ban a site from playing the game.
°Fban race bans anyone with that race from playing the game.
°Fban class bans anyone with that class from playing the game.
°Fban site/race/class without any other arguemts will give you a list of
currently banned sites/races/classes.
Type can either be a level or one of the following keywords: all,newbie,mortal,
warn. If you set it to a level everyone equal to that level and below will not
be allowed on.  °Fwarn, sends a warning to the Warn: channel that someone if
logging in from the site, with a certaing class or race.  If you add the
duration, the ban will expire in that many days. Sites can be banned with the *
wildcard as well.  Be carefull however as *.edu would ban everysite from .edu,
or *foo* would ban anysite that had the string foo in it.
°Fban show, will print out the reason why that particular site/race or class was
banned and by who.  Number can be a class or race name, a site address or
you can use # followed by the ban number.
°Fwarn will toggle the warn flag on a CURRENTLY banned site/class or race.

°Fallow site/race/class  <address/race/class>  removes a site, class or race from

&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:

&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.

&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of
the values returned for Value0 based on level:

&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0

&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted. Different wear locations have a different multiplying affect:

Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first.

In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming,
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

&YSintassi&w:  °Tclimate <&gfield&w> <&gname&w>

This command allows you to view or modify the climate
settings for an area. There are settings for temperature,
precipitation, and wind. In addition, you may specify
neighboring areas who will affect changes in the current
areas weather. Therefore there are four fields to choose
from. Each field has a different range of values available.

Field name:           Values:
temp                  cold, cool, normal, warm, hot
precip                arid, dry, normal, damp, wet
wind                  still, calm, normal, breezy, windy
neighbor              <area name>

Specifying an area name with neighbor which is already on
the list will remove it. Using climate without any arguments
will display the area's current setting. Note that this
command always refers to the area which you are currently in.

Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based on
the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.

The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy if
they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).

To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.

The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  °Taset <&garea filename&w> &glow_economy&w <&gamount&w>, this will give the
specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).

Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created with,
but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less until the
economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).

Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

°Tredit &gexit&w <&gdirection&w> [&gvnum&w] [&gexit-type&w] [&gkey&w] [&gkeyword(s)&w]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only °Tredit &gexit&w <&gdirection&w> is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
°Tredit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
°Tredit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
°Tredit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15

Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)

You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on

Somethings to keep in mind when giving/taking Glory:

  - Glory is UNtradable between mortals.  (Please do not facilitate trades of
         Glory between mortals.
  - It is allowed for a player to use his Glory to affect items for another
         player.
  - Currently, appropriate prizes to be awarded for quests are as follows:

  Avatar quests (lvl 40+):
         Suggested Maximum:  50 Glory  (For playing an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For making a notable effort)
    - Then Glory of appropriate amounts (use your judgement) can be given out
         for intermediate efforts between winning and participating.

  NOTE:  Being integral doesn't neccessarily mean landing the killing blow on
         the supermob, it might also mean the person who solved the riddle
         leading to the mob (if it was a difficult riddle).
  NOTE:  Prizes should be scaled up or down to reflect the difficulty and
         participation of the quest.  For example a difficult quest would be
         one that takes more than 2 hours to complete.

  Non-Avatar quests (lvl < 40):
         Suggested Maximum:  35 Glory  (For an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For a notable effort)

     Glory does not neccessarily have to be the only prize given out.  In fact
     for the lower level quests it is preferred if a combination of Glory and
     minorly affected/renamed objects are given out as prizes.  i.e. a weapon
     renamed to something related to the quest that has a couple +1's or +2's
     on it (that will be useful for a couple levels, but then discarded).

     NOTE:  It is suggested for Guild and Order quests that the prizes be
            scaled down slightly as participation is limited from the entire
            mud - and open exclusively to guild/order members.  The quests they
            recieve from the guild/order are supplemental to the mud-wide ones
            they can participate in.


     DISCLAIMER:  These numbers are not set in stone, they are guidelines.  The
                  QC is counting on the good judgement of the immortals to
                  make sure the prizes they are giving out are appropriate.

You may never CR for your own mortal unless _all_ the following apply:
   - There is no other Immortal online to do it for you.
   - You have tried to get your corpse on your own, with mortal assistance.
   - Your corpse is in "the last stages of decay", meaning you cannot wait
     any longer, i.e. a corpse timer of less than 8.

This command allows you to make someone execute a command.  Forcing

force is to make someone do something as you are snooping, to check

forcing them.  You may also use force to make a player quit, drop,

The °Tsnoop command is a very valuable tool, when used appropriately.  Snoop

-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are

-- If a higher level Immortals requests you to stop snooping, do so quickly.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded.

This help file will contain the current status as well as the expectations of
what is to be followed of Immortals questing.
  Currently imms &YARE&G allowed to quest.

&WRules for imm's questing:&G

 &W*&G It is expected that no Imm will be multi-playing their imm while they
   are questing.  This includes multi-playing while invis/afk/etc.

 &W*&G It is expected that no imm will log off their imm character in order to
   quest.  We don't want the situation arising where everyone logs off and the
   QC imm is stranded running the quest and fielding everything else.

 &W*&G You may &CNOT&G quest if you log in with your imm at any time during
   the quest.

&WSo when can you quest?&G

 &W*&G It's somewhat limiting, but you can quest &CIF&G you happen to be
   morting when a quest begins, &COR&G if you are given the explicit
   permission of the imm running the quest. &CPlease do not pressure them.&G


Immortals can apply once a month for a rename scroll or twenty glory.
Phalanx, on behalf of the Quest Council, and Elcid on behalf of the
Symposium are responsible for the distribution of the monthly 'payments.'
To apply for your monthly rename or share of glory, post a note on 1203
stating the month, the form in which you'd like to receive your payment
(scroll/glory), and the mortal's name that will be receiving the payment.

&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:

&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.

&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:

&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

&YSintassi&w:  °Tloadup <&gplayer&w>

°Floadup allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use °Tforce to make the character do your bidding.

If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.

So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.

If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.

Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see °Thelp &gitemvalues&w)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.

&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the °Thelp &gitemvalues&w table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in °Thelp &gweapontypes&w.

&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the °Thelp &gitemvalues&w table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.

Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

In all cases new clan applications would be taken the old way:

 - you find your three leaders (no shared leaders here)

 - you find at least two additional avatars
   ... need five avatars total start clan (3 leaders, 2 more)

 - your theme is approved by the conclave; approval is defined
   here as little more than a straining process for quality.
   If you have a theme you're willing to build on/around and
   play and it's not something like a clan that fights for the
   glory of Metallica you're probably okay

- you find a deity that's willing to help you in upkeeping
   the clan (i.e. be a mediator with other imms, help you get
   changes made, help you keep the theme of your clan going).
   You won't _have_ to have a deity all the time if it just
   really ends up that you can't keep one, but it's necessary
   to get started (though have pondered linking the function
   of certain clan bonuses such as healers, etc. to the clan
   having a deity, but that's a completely different matter)

NOTE:  This isn't to say an imm-created clan or clans may not be
       introduced, but any such clans would have stipulations on
       them and be for specific use, such as any assassin type of
       clan.  This isn't being planned, just covering bases here

Equipment option 2:  self-created

Created via purchase by the clan.  Either gold or glory or both used
to add affects to the items up to a cap.  Items would start off with
no affects, or perhaps a very, very low set of base stats
 - cap would be raised occasionally to allow more power to be added
   if stock item power overtakes it
   NOTE:  There are new areas coming in that are going to have stock
          items better than existing stock items, and some will have
          items that give unusual rewards.  The difficulty will be
          astronomical, but the value is pretty high

Affects could also be removed and replaced at the will of the clan
(i.e. adjusting the item for a cost, remove hps and add some dr, etc.)
or even stripped completely by the clan I suppose if it really wanted
to screw everyone up who had their stuff.
 -  changes to affects could either be retroactive or new eq only,
    meaning when you change a bracer every bracer out there would
    receive that change, or that change would only affect new items
    made.  This is something that would be decided at inception.

Yes, cost would be high for affects, and we have not decided on a scale
yet.  It's very unlikely that even the existing clans could foot the
bill for a set of eq comparable even to old clan stuff in a short time.
It's meant that it'll be a slower process, though I'm sure someone will
surprise us.  The advantages are a rising cap over time, the control to
adjust stats as you want and can afford, and that the eq will likely
be more powerful when capped than the divinated eq would be.

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.

Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.

If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.

°Foset &gon&w will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply °Toset <&gobject&w>.  Hitting enter while in °Toset &gon&w gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of °Toset &gon&w, simply
type the word &gdone&w.

The higher the dexterity, the lower the AC will be.  In general, the base
AC on a character will vary between 60 and 100.  In the worst case, if the
character's dexterity is very low (3 - 5) its AC can drop to 130 or so.

We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).

We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">

This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.

           °Tsetboot &gmanual&w <&g0&w|&g1&w>

The °Tsetboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

Many of the actions in the Bard are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.

Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.

Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke

When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (°Thelp
&gmpcommands&w).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.

If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:

 - Immortals level 51 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.

 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 51 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.

The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.
